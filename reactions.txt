#Here I define the reactant list. In this case I say that reaction 0 (mRNA production) doesn't depend on any amount (i.e. -1); reaction 1 (mRNA decay) depends on the amount of mRNA (i.e. species 0); same for reaction 2 (protein production); reaction 3 (protein decay) depends on the amount of protein (i.e. species 1)....
#-1 means source, i.e. reaction of tipe 0 -> A.
#-2 means proportional to volume (e.g. mRNA production is rm*V). The volume changes in time if the cell is allowed to grow
